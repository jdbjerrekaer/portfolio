## Overview

Created an internal analytics dashboard that helps product managers and designers understand user behavior and make data-driven decisions.

## The Challenge

The team relied on raw SQL queries and spreadsheets to analyze user data. This created:

- Slow insights turnaround
- Inconsistent data interpretation
- Limited access for non-technical team members

## Solution

### Data Architecture

Worked with the data team to establish:

- Consistent event tracking schema
- Real-time data pipeline
- Pre-computed aggregations for common queries

### Visualization Design

Designed visualizations following data viz best practices:

- Clear visual hierarchy
- Appropriate chart types for each data type
- Interactive filtering and drill-down
- Export capabilities

### Technical Implementation

Built with:

- **React** for UI components
- **D3.js** for custom visualizations
- **React Query** for data fetching and caching
- **TypeScript** for type safety

## Key Features

1. **Overview Dashboard**: High-level metrics with trend indicators
2. **Funnel Analysis**: Visualize user journeys and drop-off points
3. **Cohort Analysis**: Track retention across user segments
4. **Custom Reports**: Build and save custom queries

## Impact

- Product decisions now backed by data
- Time to insights reduced from days to minutes
- Democratized data access across the organization
