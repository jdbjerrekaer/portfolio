## Why I built this

I just wanted a countdown app that worked.

Every option in the App Store told the same story: cluttered interfaces, outdated design patterns, and core features locked behind paywalls that felt out of proportion to what you actually got. Want more than three countdowns? Pay. Want a widget? Pay more. Want it to look decent or support dark mode? Good luck—most hadn't been updated in months, some in years.

Meanwhile, iOS kept shipping new capabilities: modern widget APIs, refined design language, better notification handling. And these apps weren't keeping up. The gap between what a native iOS experience *should* feel like and what these apps delivered kept widening.

So I stopped waiting for someone else to fix it.

## The goal

Build a countdown app that feels like it belongs on iOS: fast, focused, and respectful of the user's time. No accounts. No paywalls for basic functionality. No visual clutter. A clean tool for tracking the dates that matter—with a sustainable model that doesn't compromise the experience.

## Overview

Countdown is a lightweight, iOS-native app for tracking important dates: birthdays, anniversaries, holidays, launches. It supports both future events (countdown) and past events (count up / "days ago"), with recurring yearly events for anything that repeats. Built with native iOS 26 UI elements, dark mode support, and Siri Shortcuts, it feels right at home on modern iOS whether you're checking at a glance or creating an event hands-free.

## My role

Solo **Design Engineer** — owned UX, UI implementation, and native integrations end-to-end.

## Goals & constraints

- **Mobile-first, thumb-friendly** layout and touch targets
- **Local-first** (no accounts required; everything persists on-device)
- **Recurring events** that "just work" year over year
- **Dark mode parity** that maintains hierarchy and contrast
- **Privacy + consent clarity** when the app needs system permissions
- **Sustainable monetization** without subscriptions or core feature lockups
- **Clear hierarchy**: title + emoji for recognition, time state for urgency, secondary details only when needed
- **Native polish** through haptics, dialogs, and notifications (without breaking on web)

## Key UX decisions

### Count down and count up in the same model

Instead of forcing separate "modes", the app treats past dates as first-class events and shows a clear "days ago" state. This supports real user mental models (e.g. "how long since we shipped?") and keeps the add flow simple.

### Recurring yearly events without duplicated items

For birthdays and anniversaries, the event stays a single entity that advances each year. The UI surfaces the *next* occurrence, and the logic calculates repetition count and next date when needed—so the list never explodes into duplicates.

### Reordering that feels physical

Drag-and-drop is initiated with an intentional long-press and uses careful transform handling to avoid the common "squish/scale" distortion during drag. The goal is a stable, confident interaction—especially on mobile where precision is harder.

### Monetization without disrupting flow

The app uses a light-touch, optional model: core features stay free, while a one-time upgrade removes ads. The design goal was to keep the interface calm and transparent. No nagging, no gated features. So the product stays trustworthy.

### Shortcuts for fast capture
Important dates often come up mid-conversation. Siri Shortcuts make creation and quick lookups feel immediate, so users can add or query a countdown without breaking context.

## Design-engineering highlights

- **Native iOS 26 components**: the app uses native iOS UI elements (buttons, lists, modals, date pickers) through Ionic's iOS mode, ensuring pixel-perfect alignment with Apple's latest Human Interface Guidelines.
- **Countdown timing hook**: a dedicated `useCountdown()` updates at 1-second intervals and cleanly handles "today", future, and past states.
- **Yearly recurrence math**: `date-fns` helpers compute next occurrence and repetition count (e.g. "28th birthday") reliably.
- **Notifications across platforms**: on iOS, notifications are scheduled via Capacitor local notifications. On web, we fall back to permission + local persistence with "check on load" behavior (because web notifications can't be scheduled arbitrarily far ahead).
- **Dark mode system**: custom theme tokens map into Ionic's palette so the UI keeps contrast and depth in both modes without duplicating layouts.
- **Siri/App Intents**: native intents for creating, listing, and querying countdowns make the app usable by voice or Shortcuts.
- **Native home screen widgets**: WidgetKit-based widgets in small, medium, and large sizes, with three display styles (Focus, Visual with progress bars, and Classic flip-clock digits). Uses App Groups for seamless data sync and supports iOS 17+ AppIntents for per-widget event selection. Tapping a widget deep-links directly to that event's edit modal. A triple-event large widget variant shows three countdowns at once.
- **Optional ad-free upgrade**: a one-time purchase with restore support and celebratory feedback, designed to feel respectful rather than transactional.
- **Privacy + consent flows**: AdMob consent/ATT handling is surfaced transparently, with a settings-based reset path to keep user control clear.
- **Calendar import**: native iOS calendar import (via a custom Capacitor plugin) and `.ics` import support. Deduplication normalizes titles across multiple languages and removes age suffixes ("48th Birthday") so yearly events map to a stable identity.
- **Internationalization**: the UI ships with multiple locales so the product can launch beyond English from day one.

## What's next

- Add short walkthrough clips to showcase key interactions
- Refine onboarding for permissions (calendar + notifications + consent) with a clearer explanation of value
