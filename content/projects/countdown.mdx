## Why I built this

I just wanted a countdown app that worked.

Every option in the App Store told the same story: cluttered interfaces, outdated design patterns, and core features locked behind paywalls that felt out of proportion to what you actually got. Want more than three countdowns? Pay. Want a widget? Pay more. Want it to look decent? Good luck—most hadn't been updated in months, some in years.

Meanwhile, iOS kept shipping new capabilities—modern widget APIs, refined design language, better notification handling—and these apps weren't keeping up. The gap between what a native iOS experience *should* feel like and what these apps delivered kept widening.

So I stopped waiting for someone else to fix it.

## The goal

Build a countdown app that feels like it belongs on iOS: fast, focused, and respectful of the user's time. No accounts. No paywalls for basic functionality. No visual clutter. Just a clean tool for tracking the dates that matter.

## Overview

Countdown is a lightweight, iOS-inspired app for tracking important dates—birthdays, anniversaries, holidays, launches—without friction. It supports both future events (countdown) and past events (count up / "days ago"), with recurring yearly events for anything that repeats.

## My role

As the **Design Engineer**, I owned the full stack:

- **UX + interaction design**: core flows, editing patterns, motion/feedback, and mobile ergonomics
- **UI implementation**: a cohesive iOS-like hierarchy using Ionic + React, styled with Tailwind + component primitives
- **Key logic**: countdown calculations, yearly recurrence, sorting behavior, and native feature integration via Capacitor

## The problem with existing apps

Most countdown apps fall into two camps: oversimplified tools with arbitrary limits, or bloated utilities with interfaces that haven't evolved since iOS 7. Neither respects users enough to offer a complete, polished experience without strings attached.

I wanted something that feels native, stays fast as the list grows, and makes recurring events effortless—without asking me to subscribe for the privilege.

## Goals & constraints

- **Mobile-first, thumb-friendly** layout and touch targets
- **Local-first** (no accounts required; everything persists on-device)
- **Recurring events** that "just work" year over year
- **Clear hierarchy**: title + emoji for recognition, time state for urgency, secondary details only when needed
- **Native polish** through haptics, dialogs, and notifications (without breaking on web)

## Key UX decisions

### Count down and count up in the same model

Instead of forcing separate "modes", the app treats past dates as first-class events and shows a clear "days ago" state. This supports real user mental models (e.g. "how long since we shipped?") and keeps the add flow simple.

### Recurring yearly events without duplicated items

For birthdays and anniversaries, the event stays a single entity that advances each year. The UI surfaces the *next* occurrence, and the logic calculates repetition count and next date when needed—so the list never explodes into duplicates.

### Reordering that feels physical

Drag-and-drop is initiated with an intentional long-press and uses careful transform handling to avoid the common "squish/scale" distortion during drag. The goal is a stable, confident interaction—especially on mobile where precision is harder.

## Design-engineering highlights

- **Countdown timing hook**: a dedicated `useCountdown()` updates at 1-second intervals and cleanly handles "today", future, and past states.
- **Yearly recurrence math**: `date-fns` helpers compute next occurrence and repetition count (e.g. "28th birthday") reliably.
- **Notifications across platforms**: on iOS, notifications are scheduled via Capacitor local notifications. On web, we fall back to permission + local persistence with "check on load" behavior (because web notifications can't be scheduled arbitrarily far ahead).
- **Calendar import**: native iOS calendar import (via a custom Capacitor plugin) and `.ics` import support. Deduplication normalizes titles across multiple languages and removes age suffixes ("48th Birthday") so yearly events map to a stable identity.
- **Internationalization**: the UI ships with multiple locales so the product can launch beyond English from day one.

## What's next

- Add a real **screenshot gallery** and short walkthrough clips once assets are ready
- Refine onboarding for permissions (calendar + notifications) with a clearer explanation of value
- Explore native home screen widget delivery (beyond preview) as a future iteration
