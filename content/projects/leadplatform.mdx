## Overview

LeadPlatform is an all-in-one lead generation product that combines the power of gamification with the technology and reach of the leading Nordic affiliate network. Instead of traditional lead capture forms, brands can engage potential customers through interactive experiences that entertain while collecting valuable marketing leads.

## Impact

The gamification approach delivers measurable results:

- **207,992 clicks** in a 20-day period — a **384.92% increase** compared to the preceding period (from 42,892 clicks)
- **7,553 conversions** captured — a **43.51% increase** compared to the preceding period (from 5,263 conversions)
- **+31% Average Conversion Rate** for quiz-based lead capture
- **Full-service solution** — design, traffic driving, and integration support included
- **Access to publisher network** — leverage the Nordic affiliate network for distribution
- **No yearly licensing** — flexible pay-per-site model

## The Problem

Traditional lead generation methods often suffer from low engagement and poor conversion rates. Standard newsletter signups and contact forms feel transactional and fail to capture user attention. Brands needed a way to stand out in a crowded digital landscape while still collecting qualified leads effectively.

## The Solution

LeadPlatform offers four distinct gamified experiences designed to capture marketing leads through entertainment:

### The Quiz

Capture potential customers' curiosity using interactive quizzes. Instead of asking customers to simply fill out a form, brands can entertain them with a quiz while receiving their contact details.

### Contest Signup

Entice potential customers to participate in a raffle by giving their information in exchange for a chance to win. This creates a clear value exchange that motivates users to share their contact details willingly.

### The Memory Game

Build product recognition while obtaining marketing leads. Users engage with brand imagery in a fun, interactive format that increases recall and engagement compared to passive advertising.

### Christmas Calendar

Expose brands through seasonal Christmas calendar campaigns. This format creates daily touchpoints with potential customers over an extended period, building brand familiarity and collecting leads progressively.

## Technical Implementation

LeadPlatform integrates seamlessly with the Adservice ecosystem:

- **Platform integration** — Access to the Adservice Platform is included for monitoring performance and integrating with other digital marketing platforms
- **Demo sites** — Live examples available for prospects to explore before committing
- **Multi-language support** — Available across Nordic markets (Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish)

## Key Features

- **Full-service approach** — One partner handles site creation, traffic driving, and integration
- **Gamified experiences** — Four distinct engagement formats (Quiz, Contest, Memory Game, Christmas Calendar)
- **Performance tracking** — Built-in analytics to monitor campaign effectiveness
- **Flexible pricing** — Pay per site rather than yearly licensing fees

LeadPlatform demonstrates how gamification can transform lead generation from a passive form-filling exercise into an engaging brand experience that users actually want to participate in.
