## The Problem

After inheriting design files from a colleague, I found myself spending countless hours manually checking for design inconsistencies, naming conventions, and adherence to our design system. This repetitive cleanup work was not only time-consuming but also error-prone, leaving room for inconsistencies to slip through.

## The Solution

YADL (Yet Another Design Linter) is a comprehensive Figma plugin that automates design system compliance checks. It provides smart suggestions across 12 key areas of design quality:

- **Generic layer names** - Identifies layers that need better naming conventions
- **Typography** - Ensures consistent font usage, sizes, and line heights
- **Padding** - Validates spacing within elements
- **Gap** - Checks spacing between elements
- **Stroke** - Verifies border and stroke consistency
- **Colors** - Ensures proper use of design system colors
- **Effects** - Validates shadows, blurs, and other effects
- **Border radius** - Checks corner rounding consistency
- **Locked layers** - Identifies layers that may need to be unlocked
- **Hidden layers** - Finds unnecessary hidden layers
- **Nested components** - Validates component structure
- **Broken variables** - Detects issues with design tokens and variables

## Impact

What started as a tool to solve my own workflow challenges has become a valuable resource for the Figma community, with adoption spanning from global financial institutions to innovative startups worldwide. The plugin's success is evident in Figma's response—they're developing a similar feature called "Check designs" for their platform. However, their version is only available to Organization and Enterprise plan users and is currently in early access, requiring users to apply for access through a waitlist.

YADL has found its way into design workflows at major organizations including **Goldman Sachs**, where it helps maintain consistency across complex financial product interfaces, as well as numerous companies across India and other regions that rely on it to scale their design operations. The plugin's global reach demonstrates that design system compliance is a universal challenge, regardless of company size or industry.

The impact extends beyond individual teams—YADL has become a critical tool for design teams working across time zones and cultures, ensuring that design quality standards remain consistent even when collaboration happens remotely. Designers from solo practitioners to enterprise teams have integrated YADL into their daily workflows, saving countless hours that would otherwise be spent on manual design audits and cleanup work.

YADL remains **free and accessible to everyone**, democratizing design system compliance for teams of all sizes. Whether you're a solo designer or part of a large organization, YADL helps maintain design quality and consistency without the barriers of enterprise pricing. This commitment to accessibility has made design system compliance achievable for teams that might not have the budget for enterprise-grade solutions, leveling the playing field for designers everywhere.
