## Overview

A complete redesign of a mobile banking app focused on simplifying complex financial tasks and improving accessibility for all users.

## The Challenge

The existing app had poor usability metrics:

- 45% task abandonment rate for transfers
- Low accessibility scores
- Frequent customer support calls for basic tasks
- Outdated visual design

## Research

### User Interviews

Conducted 20+ interviews with diverse users, including those with accessibility needs. Key insights:

- Users wanted quick access to frequent actions
- Navigation was confusing and nested too deeply
- Important information was hard to find

### Competitive Analysis

Analyzed 8 competing apps to identify best practices and opportunities for differentiation.

## Design Process

### Information Architecture

Restructured the app around user goals rather than banking products:

- **Home**: Quick actions and account overview
- **Move Money**: All transfer types in one place
- **Insights**: Spending patterns and budgets
- **More**: Settings and less frequent features

### Prototyping

Created high-fidelity prototypes in Figma, with interactive components for usability testing. Iterated through 3 major versions based on testing feedback.

### Accessibility

Ensured the design met WCAG 2.1 AA standards:

- Minimum touch targets of 44x44px
- Clear color contrast ratios
- Screen reader optimized flows
- Reduced motion options

## Results

After launch:

- **Task completion** increased from 55% to 89%
- **App Store rating** improved from 2.8 to 4.6
- **Support calls** decreased by 35%
- **Accessibility audit** passed with zero critical issues

## Reflection

This project reinforced the importance of inclusive design from the start. What's accessible is often better for everyone.
