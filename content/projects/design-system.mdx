## Overview

This project involved creating a scalable design system that could serve multiple products while maintaining consistency and accessibility standards.

## The Challenge

The organization had multiple products, each with their own styling and component implementations. This led to:

- Inconsistent user experiences across products
- Duplicated development effort
- Difficulty maintaining accessibility standards
- Slow design-to-development handoff

## Approach

### Research & Discovery

Started by auditing existing components across all products, identifying patterns, and documenting inconsistencies. Conducted interviews with designers and developers to understand pain points.

### Token Architecture

Established a token-based foundation:

- **Color tokens**: Semantic naming (e.g., `color-text-primary` instead of `gray-900`)
- **Spacing scale**: Consistent 4px-based scale
- **Typography**: Modular scale with clear hierarchy

### Component Design

Built components following these principles:

1. **Composability**: Small, focused components that combine well
2. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance baked in
3. **Flexibility**: Props for common variations, slots for customization
4. **Documentation**: Live examples, guidelines, and do's/don'ts

## Results

After rolling out the design system:

- **40% faster** design-to-development time
- **Consistent** experience across 5 products
- **100%** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Reduced** CSS bundle size by 35%

## Key Learnings

Building a design system is as much about people and processes as it is about components. Success required ongoing communication, training, and iteration based on team feedback.
